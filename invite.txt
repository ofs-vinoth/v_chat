Dear friends,Red rose
 

                        "You might be the backbone of your Project / Organization,
                        then the production roll might come to a standstill if you take holiday, Microsoft might adopt java technology and
                        Oracle might takeover .Net technology in case of your absence.
                        But it is our marriage reception and your presence is vital there.
                         As we are not much used to exception handling,
                        Please do not throw any exceptions for justifying your absence".

 

    Be there for Our Wedding and Reception to be held on Thursday, the 24th of September 2015 between 4.30 p.m and 9.00 p.m at Shrine Of Our Lady Of Good Health, Little Mount, Saidapet, Chennai â€“ 600015.
